# UX-display-site
A site displaying UX concepts
• This project was made using Javascript, Html and CSS<br>
• I created this as an example for a UX design given the redish color and a carbon theme as the focus.<br>
• I applied various design principles such as, similarity, area, common fate and occulsion.<br>
• I also used centering and emphasis to make the important elements stand out for the user of the site.<br>
• This project was one of my first attempts at a website and I found that I quickly took to it and worked hard to aim for perfection.<br>
